The deployment directory contains a Dockerfile, a docker-compose.yml file, and Kubernetes deployment and service YAML files. These will help you containerize and deploy your RAG-powered microservice in various environments.

Let's start with the implementations:

1. Dockerfile:



```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM python:3.9-slim as builder

WORKDIR /app

# Install system dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    build-essential \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install Python dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip wheel --no-cache-dir --no-deps --wheel-dir /app/wheels -r requirements.txt

# Final stage
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

# Copy built wheels from builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/wheels /wheels

# Install Python dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache /wheels/*

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Set environment variables
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 \
    PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 \
    PYTHONPATH=/app

# Expose port
EXPOSE 8000

# Run the application
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]

```

2. docker-compose.yml:



```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  rag-microservice:
    build:
      context: ..
      dockerfile: deployment/Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - MONGODB_URL=mongodb://mongodb:27017/ragdb
      - REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
    depends_on:
      - mongodb
      - redis

  mongodb:
    image: mongo:4.4
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
    volumes:
      - mongodb_data:/data/db

  redis:
    image: redis:6.2-alpine
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
    volumes:
      - redis_data:/data

volumes:
  mongodb_data:
  redis_data:

```

3. Kubernetes Deployment:



```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: rag-microservice
  labels:
    app: rag-microservice
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: rag-microservice
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: rag-microservice
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: rag-microservice
        image: your-registry/rag-microservice:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8000
        env:
        - name: MONGODB_URL
          value: "mongodb://mongodb-service:27017/ragdb"
        - name: REDIS_URL
          value: "redis://redis-service:6379/0"
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 100m
            memory: 128Mi
          limits:
            cpu: 500m
            memory: 512Mi
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /health
            port: 8000
          initialDelaySeconds: 10
          periodSeconds: 5
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /health
            port: 8000
          initialDelaySeconds: 15
          periodSeconds: 10

```

4. Kubernetes Service:



```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: rag-microservice-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: rag-microservice
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8000
  type: ClusterIP  # Change to LoadBalancer or NodePort if external access is needed

```

These implementations provide a comprehensive setup for deploying your RAG-powered microservice:

1. The Dockerfile sets up a clean, efficient container for your application.
2. The docker-compose.yml file allows for easy local development and testing with all necessary services.
3. The Kubernetes deployment.yaml file defines how your application should be deployed in a Kubernetes cluster, including scaling and health checks.
4. The Kubernetes service.yaml file exposes your application within the cluster.

To use these in your project:

1. Place the Dockerfile in your project's root directory.
2. Place the docker-compose.yml file in the deployment directory.
3. Place the deployment.yaml and service.yaml files in the deployment/kubernetes directory.

For local development and testing:
```bash
docker-compose -f deployment/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

For Kubernetes deployment:
```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment/kubernetes/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f deployment/kubernetes/service.yaml
```

Remember to adjust the following:

- In the Dockerfile, ensure the `COPY` commands accurately reflect your project structure.
- In docker-compose.yml, adjust environment variables as needed for your specific configuration.
- In the Kubernetes files, replace `your-registry/rag-microservice:latest` with your actual container registry and image details.
- Ensure you have a `/health` endpoint in your FastAPI application for the readiness and liveness probes.

These configurations provide a solid starting point, but you may need to adjust them based on your specific requirements, such as adding additional services, configuring persistent volumes for MongoDB and Redis in Kubernetes, setting up ingress, etc.
